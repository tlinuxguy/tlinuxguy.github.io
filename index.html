<b>The Linux Guy</b>

Is your computer slow? Are you sick and tired of Windows or MacOS? Did you 
know there is a free alternative called Linux?

Linux is a free operating system that works brilliantly on all types of 
computers. Don't throw away your old computer, revive it with Linux! Because 
Linux is free, the only thing you pay for is my time.

<b>My service</b>
<u>Linux installation</u>: $50 + $20 callout fee (installation includes 
setting up printers etc, plus a tutorial on how to use Linux)

<u>Post-installation support</u>: $50 p/hr

All you need to do beforehand is back up your data - I do the rest!

<b>Contact</b>
<u>Phone</u>: 0406429160
<u>Email</u>: tycc@mailo.com 
For information on two variants of Linux that I recommend visit these websites:
